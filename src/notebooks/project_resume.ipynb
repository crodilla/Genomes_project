    "Over 9000 rare diseases have been described and up to 350 million people worldwide suffer from one. While individually, these diseases are rare (affecting 5-6% of the population),  in aggregate they represent a substantial challenge to global health systems. The majority of rare disorders are genetic in origin, with children under the age of five disproportionately affected (83%). Due to disease heterogeneity and unknown variant pathogenicity, about half of patients with rare genetic diseases never receive a causal diagnosis. However, making a molecular diagnosis with current technologies and knowledge is often still a challenge.\n",
    "Thus understanding the clinically implications of genetic and phenotypic variation is crucial for delivering an early diagnose and treatment for these patients."
